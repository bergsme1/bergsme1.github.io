        <p>The quintessential big box board game. For years this game has defined the coffin sized, intimidating gatekeepers of the hobby. Twilight Imperium is a gorgeous space opera combing interplanetary politics, trade, and massive space ship battles.</p>

        <p>Playing this game is a huge commitment with rules explanation taking upwards of two hours, gameplay often taking all day, and a massive table required to fit all the components.</p>

        <p>Players begin the game by selecting a player board that explains the special abilities of an alien race. The players then construct the board by laying tiles from their hand. Each round consists of players taking actions such as exploring, building, or fighting. Each player also selects a special phase which will allow every player to take a special action but provides a special bonus to the player who picked it. Complicating things further is the battle of political intrigue consisting of voting on laws that apply new rules to the game.</p>

        <p>Despite all the complications and the extremely long play time, this game moves very quickly. It seems every moment you arenâ€™t actively moving a piece you are planning your next turn, calculating moves and unit costs, and looking forward 2 or 3 rounds in the future.</p>
