        <p>This is a classic board game that has been around for decades. Unfortunately the game design shows that. This is a very basic game that is very luck based and hardly more than a roll and move. The redeeming quality of the game is its theme, allowing players to embrace a character in a high fantasy world.</p>

        <p>The goal of this game is to increase your character stats and work your way inward on the board to acquire the Crown of Command and finally defeat all the other players. Movement is determined by a roll and encounters are random. Players defeat monsters and buy equipment to become stronger and make challenges easier.</p>

        <p>The decision space of the game is essentially limited to which direction you choose to move and at what point you decide to move inward on the board. There is practically no depth to the game and <em>play stretches on for over an hour.</em></p>

        <p>Experienced gamers will likely find themselves bored or exhausted with the tedium of roll-move-pass. As an introductory game it does a fine job of building a bridge between simple games like Monopoly and Sorry! and more complicated games in the hobby.</p>

        <p>That’s not to say the game can’t be fun but it is very dependent on the fun the players bring to the table. Approached as a role playing, social, or drinking game players of all levels should find the hour and a half time commitment worth while.</p>
