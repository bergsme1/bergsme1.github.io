        <p>A personal favorite of mine, this game balances a fierce competition with intense back and forth and multiple win conditions. Adding to my love of this game is the gorgeous artwork and deep flavor of the Irish mythos.</p>

        <p>The game uses a number of mechanics which experienced players will be able to recognize and adapt to quickly. For players unfamiliar with some of the mechanics, I think this is an excellent introduction. The most important mechanics are <strong>area control</strong>, <strong>card drafting</strong>, <strong>hand management</strong>, and <strong>variable phase order</strong>.</p>

        <p>Each round begins with drafting a hand of cards that will become your actions for that round. The draft is more interesting than usual because each card you draft is added to the cards you are passed, then you select two cards, then three, then are passed your final card. This lets you adapt your drafting strategy on the fly.</p>

        <p>Turns are then taken by playing your cards one at a time or passing. There are a wide variety of actions that you can take with a number of responses that can also be played. Besides action cards there are two other sets of cards that can affect your decisions, Epic Tale cards that are powerful one time effects and Advantage cards which reward you for controlling tiles of the map.</p>

        <p>The three separate win conditions make play tense. Players have to keep an eye on all of their opponents while quietly advancing in their own way.</p>
